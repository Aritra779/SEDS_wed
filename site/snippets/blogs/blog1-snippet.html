	  		<p>What are we ? </p>

	<p>A mere speck of dust abandoned over a tiny chunk of rock wandering in space !?</p>

	<p>And are we alone ?</p>

	<p>Well, if , the universe is capable of creating life on planet earth, then in some other corner of the room the similar conditions might also have been occurred ! the earth sets itself as an example to tell us that we are not alone in this cosmic ocean.</p>

	<p><q>If we do not get fish caught in a bucket of water from the ocean , doesn’t mean that there are no fish in the entire ocean </q></p>

	<p>We just need to explore…..</p>

	<p>We the “only” beings considered so far spend the whole 70 years thinking about what kind of cloths do we need to wear forget that we live on a sphere which revolves around a average sized star which bounds its children by the harmony of gravity. Ah….felt tiny , in front of cosmic arena ? We , a hamper of feelings and result of millions of evolution are nothing in size in front of this vast expansion of space and time , but ! our thoughts and ideas are not small…..</p>

	 

	<p>Perhaps you may have stood out in the open only just last night to watch the sky full of ghosts! Perhaps, too, you murmured softly to yourself , as you so often have–</p>



	<p><q>Twinkle Twinkle little star, How I wonder what you are</q></p>

	 

	<p>Eight hundred and ninety one , 892 , 893 ……… 1 trillion and a n half , How many are there ? Where do they end? The big numbers with wicked sounding names……followed by more zeros that anyone could ever write! There’s no biggest number, you can always add 1 . Suddenly everything feels lot bigger! , except for me…</p>

	 

	<p>I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars. Night after night I look at the stars. But what are they? for my folks they weren’t much more than lights in the sky , for my friends they were as mysterious to them as they were to me , as for my teachers , if the stars weren’t in the curriculum, it was as if they didn’t exist .</p>



	<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast, cosmic arena. Our posturing, our imagined self-importance , the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe..are challenge by the existential consciousness of universe. Our planet is a lonely speck…in the great, enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity…in all this vastness. </p>



	<p>There is no hint that help will come from elsewhere…to save us from ourselves. The earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future to which our species could migrate. </p>

	<p>Visit ? Yes.</p>

	<p>Settle ? Not yet . </p>

	<p>Like it or not , for the moment, the earth is where we make our stand . </p>

	  

	<p>Only a few centuries ago, a mere second of cosmic time we knew nothing of where or when we were , oblivious to the rest of cosmos , we inhabited a kind of prison of becoming a social and political insect bounded in a nutshell . But we did escape from the prison.......</p>

	 

	<p>Seeing is not believing, our senses can deceive us. Even the stars are not what they appear to be. The cosmos, revealed by science is stranger than we ever could have imagined. Light , time , space and gravity…conspire to create realities which lie beyond human consciousness and to preserve and cherish the only home we’ve ever known .</p>

	<p>That’s where we’re headed. </p>



	<p>Think with me.........</p>

	<p>The magic trick light does with time ! Do you Believe in ghosts ? no? but I do ! you would not have thought so .wait a min, ohh no , Not in human kind of ghosts, No , Not at all !! But look up and see sky full of them. “The stars” you might be thinking . every star is similar to our sun , just imagine how far away from us you’d have to move the sun to make it appear as small and faint as a star . The light from the stars travels very fast. Faster than anything. But not infinitely fast. It takes time for their light to reach us. For the nearest one, it takes years , for others , centuries. Some stars are so far away , it takes eons for their light to get to Earth . By the time light from some stars get here…..they are already dead ! For those stars , we only see their ghosts . We see their light…but their bodies perished long ,long ago. Whenever we look up we look in the past, Millions of years into past . We cannot look out into space without seeing back in time. In one second light travels 300,000 Kms and that’s nearly the distance from earth to moon . so the moon is about one light-second away. The next time you look at the moon , you’ll be seeing one second into the past…</p>

	 

	<p>Someday, man will venture beyond this planetary system ,through a dark illimitable ocean to the planets of other stars......</p>

	<p>we began as wanderers , and we are wanderers still......</p>

	<p>Millions of worlds to visit ! </p>

	<p>We are drifting in great ocean of space and time .</p>

	<p>In that ocean , the events that shape the future are working themselves out.</p>

	<p>There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of planet Earth. The cosmos is rich beyond measure with billions upon billions of stars </p>



	<p><q>The cosmos is also within us, the nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, everything we are made of was forged in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of star stuff, We are star stuff. We are a way of cosmos to know itself. Star stuff…..contemplating the stars .</q></p>

	<p>- Prof. Carl Sagan</p>



	<p>Jst Look up in the night sky ......surrender to the cosmic vibration, release all that sets you down......surrender.........</p>

	 

	<p><q>For small creatures such as we , the vastness is bearable only through love  </q></p>

	 

	<p>Think of the possibilities…..</p>
	<p>To all the curious minds , thinkers of past and the future..</p>

	<p>Thank you !</p>

	  <p>Everything seems alot bigger , except for me........</p>

	  <p>Yet another creation of star stuff…</p>
